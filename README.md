# Logistic Regression Part II


# Goal

Build logistic regression model for breast cancer dataset with all included features

# End result

The model performance was overll good with recall of 91%  recall and 92% for precision for the detetion of malignant tumors.

Reciever operationg characteristics (ROC) and area under curve (AUC)

# Conclusion

We have built a supervised machine learning algorithm- Logistic Regression based on breast cancer dataset. The logistic regression model accurately predict if tumor is benign or malignant with excellent performance ( good recall and precision metrics).
